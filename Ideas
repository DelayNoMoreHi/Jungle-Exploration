Words that should show after the player gets into the hidden room (by Waylen) :

<p class="intro">All your life you have been searching the globe for treasures, magical items forged by the very gods that created man. You go to an isolated jungle and find the hidden ruins of Rome untouched by humans teeming with vines. You step forward and hear a mighty roar, you run see huge bear that was 6 feet tall with teeth like razors. You run so far away that you can't see the bear or where you are....</p>
Dr.Italic's life, determined to search mystery things.
