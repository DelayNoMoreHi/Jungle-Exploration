# Letter From Dr.Italic
  _Hi, I'm Dr.Italic.My whoel life has been devoted into the mystery that is yet solve by science. Well, things happened. I've seeen a lot, curses in ancient tribe, totems that being praise by villages, but nothing seems real. Now I know I was wrong, maybe, just maybe, there is really some kind of mighty power that is controlling our world. I came to this jungle, where no one has ever stood on with my own private plane. Then, I saw a big beast. It attackd my plane, and my plane crashd onto the jungle after we dumpd some stuff trying to decrease our weight. All of the people die, includeing the pilot, my long time friend, and my little snowman that I build to inspire myself. I was forced to search and survive in this jungle. Until one day, a man come to me._
  
  _He looks like a good guy, but I don't know where he came from, and he never tells me anything about his... anything. Only that he tells me that when I get the compass, I can know the secret of the jungle. Then, old stuffs happen, adventure, mystery, beast attacking, all sorts of things. Then I finally found the compass, and it leads me to the north. Right there, I saw a ruin, but as its name indicates, its actually a huge castle, untouched by human, teeming with vines. In there, I saw a beast, very different than the one that I have fought, I got defeat in seconds. I thought that man is gonna to help me, but he doesn't. Later, I was trapped in the prison of the ruin. That man appears and talk to me, he claims himself Nero, the King of Roman, and all the beasts are his avatars. I was shocked, but I still accept his view point. Nero said that he was going to kill me soon, and, without mercy, he actually did. I didn't die, as I know that, I become the tiniest dust, but not dead. It was until then, I know the power of the Roman Aura that is active all the time which keep people in the jungle alive. Like you, you must have try to explore the jungle multiple times, don't you? But everytime you are dead, starve to death, beaten by the beast, you always come back at the origin, you never die. That's the Roman Aura, keeping you alive all the time. Well, enough talk, now you know who am I, do what you suppose to do._

_Sincerely,_

_Dr.Italic_

_Best Regard_

# About the Black Village
  _You know about the Black Village right? There are a lots of mystery about this village, but one thing can be sure. If you get to this
Black Village, you will know what I meant. The buildings are white, but in contrast, all villagers are black, pure black. It's not like
their skin color is black or anything, but their whole body, is black, I attached an illustration on the back of the envelop to let you
know what is that looks like. Well, they are still, considerably, humans. Somehow, they can't leave the Black Village, its like a special force that holds them there. _

  _One quick story, I saw someone in the Black Village that looks like my long time friend, Bold. What looks like means is that his hair style is pretty similar. What interest me is that I found Bold's pendant in his house. Now I really think that he is Bold, but I was not sure. I try to ask him directly, he doesn't answer anything. After that, I give up trying, just knowing that he is fine is enough for me.

# About the Roman Aura
 Â _The Roman Aura keeps people alive, you know that right? But I after my research, not all people will be kept alive by Roman Aura, only some, but they all got a same characteristic: the will to live. People without the will to live will be treated as a lost soul, not dead, not alive, only merely a human shape. They also will slowly lose theor memory, little bu little, as they can not gain more. And yes, they're the black villagers. My friend, Bold, also a member of thr the black villager, has lost his memory. I feel sad, so, never give up your will to live. If uou lose your will to live, you are a merely phantom, lost in the black village.
  
# Julius Caesar's words
  You know me, right? I'm Julius Caesar, emperor of Rome. After a long period of waiting, I get a thought, of not living anymore. At first, it's only a small thought, but as time progress, it gets bigger and bigger. Now, I'm near the edge of being blacken. I have always in regrets of one things, the building of the Roman Aura, it keeps people who should be dead alive. Its very bad, very very bad. Only one thing I can be sure, I'll be blacken in a few day, so, young man, if you want, do you want to be the king of Rome?
# The Poem:
/*
we voyage far

for tresures thats lost 

in the shadows of history

remain unknown to man


If you go east

You encounter the beast

The beast escape to east

the chase has cease
