# Letter From Dr.Italic
  _Hi, I'm Dr.Italic. All my life have been devoted into the mystery that is yet solve by science. Well, things happened. I've seeen a lot, curses in ancient tribe, totems that being praise by villages, but nothing seems real. Now I know I was wrong, maybe, just maybe, there is really some kind of mighty power that is controlling our world. I came to this jungle, where no one has ever step on, with my own private plane. Then, I saw a big beast. It attacks my plane, and my plane crash onto the jungle after we dump some stuffs trying to release our weight. All people die, include the pilot, my long time friend, and my little snowman that I build to inspire myself. I was forced to search and survive in this jungle. Until one day, a man has come to me._
  _He looks like a good guy, but I don't know where he came from, and he never tells me anything about his... anything. Only that he tells me that when I get the compass, I can know the secret of the jungle. Then, old stuffs happen, adventure, mystery, beast attacking, all sorts of things. Then I finally found the compass, and it leads me to the north. Right there, I saw a ruin, but as its name indicates, its actually a huge castle, untouched by human, teeming with vines. In there, I saw a beast, very different than the one that I have fought, I got defeat in seconds. I thought that man is gonna to help me, but he doesn't. Later, I was trapped in the prison of the ruin. That man appears and talk to me, he claims himself Nero, the King of Roman, and all the beasts are his avatars. I was shocked, but I still accept his view point. Nero said that he was going to kill me soon, and, without mercy, he actually did. I didn't die, as I know that, I become the tiniest dust, but not dead. It was until then, I know the power of the Roman Aura that is active all the time which keep people in the jungle alive. Like you, you must have try to explore the jungle multiple times, don't you? But everytime you are dead, starve to death, beaten by the beast, you always come back at the origin, you never die. That's the Roman Aura, keeping you alive all the time. Well, enough talk, now you know who am I, do what you suppose to do._

_Sincerely,_
_Dr.Italic_
_Best Regard_

# The Poem:
/*
we voyage far

for tresures thats lost 

in the shadows of history

remain unknown to man


If you go east

You encounter the beast

The beast escape to east

the chase has cease
